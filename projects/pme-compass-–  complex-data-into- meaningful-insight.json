  "description": "In today’s music industry, information on royalties, streams, live performance revenues, and fan engagement is fragmented across multiple systems, often accessible only to major players. PME Compass aims to democratize this data, giving artists the same clarity and control over their careers as record labels have long enjoyed. \n\n\nThe project combines strategic design, deep artist research, and data-driven service development to create a transparent, intuitive ecosystem where creativity and insight coexist. PME Compass helps artists make informed decisions without compromising their artistic integrity, while enabling PME to support its roster through data-led mentoring and long-term career planning.\n\nAt its core, PME Compass represents a shift toward fairness, transparency, and empowerment in the music industry. Turning complex data into meaningful insight for those who create the art itself."
