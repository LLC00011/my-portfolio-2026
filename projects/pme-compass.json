  "description": "\n\n## The Challenge\n\nIn today's music industry, information on royalties, streams, live performance revenues, and social metrics is fragmented across multiple systems, often controlled by major players. PME Compass aims to democratize this data, giving artists the same clarity and control over their careers as record labels have, while keeping enjoyment front and center.\n\n## The Approach\n\nThe project combines strategic design, deep artist research, and data-driven service development to create a transparent, intuitive ecosystem where creativity and insight coexist. PME Compass helps artists make informed decisions without compromising their artistic integrity, while enabling PME to support its roster through detailed mentoring and long-term career planning.\n\n## Project Approach\n\nPME Compass was developed through a human-centered, multi-phase design process led by Helion in collaboration with PME Records.\n\n### Drivers of Change & Vision\n\nA validated service vision and prototype for a next-generation data platform that empowers artists while reinforcing PME's position as an innovative, artist-first music company.\n\n## Impact\n\nAt its core, PME Compass represents a shift toward fairness, transparency, and empowerment in the music industry. Turning complex data into meaningful insight for those who create the art itself."
